	<h1>The learn enough story</h1>
	<p>
	Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
	technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
	command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
	everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
	Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
	We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
	learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
	movement, sign up for our official email list now.
