            The <a href="http://www.sofcover.io/">softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like
            the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>
                    Ruby-on-Rails</em></a> tutorial book and Learn Enough HTML
            to be dangerous, but it's also good for making more traditional books such as <em>Moby-Dick</em> by
            <em>Herman Melville</em>(sometimes written as
            Moby-Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverant book report on this classic of American
            Literature.

                <em>Moby-Dick by Herman Melville</em></a> begins with these immortal words:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago etcetc.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
            Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
            jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who--<em>spoiler
                alert!</em>--is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
