            The <a href="http://www.sofcover.io/">softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like
            the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>
                    Ruby-on-Rails</em></a> tutorial book and Learn Enough HTML
            to be dangerous, but it's also good for making more traditional books such as <em>Moby-Dick</em> by
            <em>Herman Melville</em>(sometimes written as
            Moby-Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverant book report on this classic of American
            Literature.

                <em>Moby-Dick by Herman Melville</em></a> begins with these immortal words:
        </p>

        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">
            <p>
                <span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in
                my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see
                the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
                circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
                November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing
                up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that
                it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
                methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time tozz get to sea as soon as I can.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
            Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
            jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who--<em>spoiler
                alert!</em>--is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
